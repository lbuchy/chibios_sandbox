Sandbox-specific files for compiling under ChibiOS. These are files related to
Sandbox intellectual property and are kept in a private repository.

For compilation, a ChibiOS copy is assumed to have been checked out into
the same directory as the Sandbox active_safety directory (e.g. a local GitHub 
directory). This structure allows the chibiOS component to be independently 
updated.

Directories that have identical names as those in the ChibiOS repository 
(e.g. boards) contain Sandbox-specific files that are of no interest to the
general ChibiOS community.
